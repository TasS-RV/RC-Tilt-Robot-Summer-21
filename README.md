# RC-tilt-robot-Summer-21
Repository of the Arduino Code for Robot controlled using Arduino Microcontroller, worked on during Summer 2021 period. Predominantly controlled by Gyroscope tilt angle.


It is controlled with linear motion control using inputs from a Gyroscope and remote control of a mechanical claw using Joysticks.
